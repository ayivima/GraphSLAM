# GraphSLAM

###### Author: Victor Mawusi Ayi

This project is a python implementation of Graph Simultaneous Localization and Mapping(SLAM). It is inspired by my final project work of the Computer Vision Nanodegree, and is aimed at further exploration of the utility of SLAM for robotic navigation and mapping.

## Select Navigation Maps of A Robot using this project's SLAM implementation

In the maps below, a robot moves around its environment while preventing itself from crashing into landmarks or obstacles. The robot is represented as the red triangle, landmarks are represented by blue circles, and the path of the robot is represented as a gray line.
